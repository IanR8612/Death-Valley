# Death-Valley
Repository for the Unity final project for LD1:

Group Members: Dominic Castaneda, Nathan Cuadros, Sevan Levonian, Jaewon Park, Ian Reafsnyder 

You are a competitor in an arena. You will face waves upon waves of enemies
that will try their hardest to kill you. You found yourself here because there
was nowhere else to turn. Your goal is to make it to the highest wave that you can.

Use WASD to move. Use the mouse to aim your weapon. Hold down the left mouse
button to fire your weapon.

At the end of each wave, you will be given a new weapon. Use E to take the
weapon and begin the next round.

As you make it into higher waves, your weapons will get better. Better weapons
have colored marks on them. Green weapons are better than stock weapons, and
blue weapons are better than green.

When enemies die, they will sometimes drop a health pack. Simply walk onto it
to use it. You'll need it. When you die, press restart to try again.

Oh, and you WILL die.

A lot.
